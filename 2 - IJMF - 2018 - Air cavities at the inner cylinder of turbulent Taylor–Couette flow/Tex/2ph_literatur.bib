	Abstract = {A coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method is presented for modeling incompressible two-phase flows with surface tension. The coupled algorithm conserves mass and captures the complicated interfaces very accurately. A planar simulation of bubble growth is performed in water at near critical pressure for different degrees of superheat. The effect of superheat on the frequency of bubble formation has been analyzed. In addition, simulation of film boiling and bubble formation is performed in refrigerant R134a at near critical and far critical pressures. The effect of saturation pressure on the frequency of bubble formation has also been studied. A deviation from the periodic bubble release is observed in the case of superheat beyond 15 K in water. The effect of heat flux on the instability has also been analyzed. It is found that for water at near critical condition, a decrease in superheat from 15 to 10 K leads to oscillations with subharmonics influencing the time period of the ebullition cycle.

The experiments were conducted under highly-controlled conditions, using electrically heated, vapor-deposited sub-micron metallic films. A high-speed. high-resolution infrared camera was used to visualize dynamic thermal patterns on the heater's surface over a broad range of heat fluxes, starting from the onset of nucleation and up to boiling crisis. Both fresh heaters and aged heaters were experimented with. The heaters' surface nanomorphology and chemistry were characterized with atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. First-of-a-kind experimental data on nucleation and boiling heat transfer at high heat fluxes are presented, and a stark difference between fresh and aged heaters is revealed. Remarkable are the origin, evolution and dynamics of the heater dryout process (leading to burnout), identified quantitatively and captured in action for the first time.

	Abstract = {This is Part II of a two-part paper on the boiling crisis phenomenon. Here we report on burnout experiments conducted on fresh and aged heaters in pool boiling. Critical heat fluxes (CHFs) were found to vary from 50% to 140% of the hydrodynamic limit, previously thought to exist at well-wetting conditions. The burnout events were captured in action (for the first time), using highspeed, high-resolution infrared thermometry. Based on these observations and in conjunction with the levels of CHF reached, we are led to conclude that the phenomenon cannot be (macro)hydrodynamically limited, at east at normal pressure and gravity conditions.Based on infrared thermometry, and aided by X-ray radiography data on void fraction, the case for a scale separation phenomenon in high heat flux pool boiling is argued. This indicates that boiling crisis is controlled by the microhydrodynamics and rupture of an extended liquid microlayer, sitting and vaporizing autonomously on the heater surface. Further. the detailed dynamics of this microlayer, as revealed by our experiments. demonstrates that all previous thermally based models of boiling crisis are inappropriate.

Asymmetric glycerol droplet shapes, arising from patterns of alternating hydrophilic (pristine SiO2) and hydrophobic (fluoroalkylsilane self-assembled monolayers) stripes with dimensions in the low-micrometer range, are investigated in relation to stripe widths. Owing to the well-defined small droplet volume, the equilibrium shape as well as the observed contact angles exhibit unique scaling behavior. Only the relative width of hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes proves to be a relevant parameter. Our results on morphologically flat, chemically patterned surfaces show similarities with those of experiments on topographically corrugated substrates. They are discussed in terms of the energetics at the liquid-solid interface.},

The model requires only bubble site densities and departure diameters. Further quantities except the thermophysical properties are not needed. From the results bubble growth rates can be derived. As an example nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients of R-114 were calculated. They agree with experimental values within the experimental accuracy.},

Here the authors demonstrate experimentally with microparticle tracking velocimetry that the strongest forcing of particles occurs during a very brief time interval of the bubble oscillation period. During this interval a jet flow impacts and spreads radially along the surface, thus transporting the particles with it. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a
   subgroup of QW7437 microbubbles, dodecafluoropentane-based ultrasound
   contrast microspheres, resides for prolonged periods in the
   microvasculature. BACKGROUND QW7437 produces echo enhancement in
   myocardium which may persist relatively longer than opacification in
   the left ventricular cavity. The mechanism for this persistent
   enhancement remains unknown.
   METHODS The transit of fluorescently labeled erythrocytes nas examined
   by fluorescence intravital microscopy in the microvessels in five rat
   mesenteries. Ten rats were used to observe the behavior of
   fluorescently labeled QW7437 microbubbles in the mesenteric
   microcirculation.
   RESULTS There was no significant change in erythrocyte velocity in the
   arterioles and venules after the administration of QW7437 microbubbles
   (0.05 ml/kg) preactivated by negative hydrodynamic pressure. Of 552
   microbubbles observed in four arterioles and five capillaries, 549
   (99.5\%) passed without stoppage (greater than or equal to 0.1 s
   stoppage); only one stopped transiently in arteriole and two in
   capillaries, each for <0.5 s. Sixty-five of 478 microbubbles (13.6\%)
   observed in six postcapillary venules 11 to 30 mu m in diameter and 24
   of 408 microbubbles (5.9\%) in four venules 31 to 50 mu m in diameter
   stopped transiently (0.1 to 180 s) with an attachment to venular
   endothelium; the remaining microbubbles passed through the venules
   without Stoppage.
   CONCLUSIONS Prolonged survival as microbubbles in the circulation and
   transient stoppage of a subgroup of microbubbles in the
   microvasculature, particularly in venules, are potential mechanisms for
   the persistent tissue echo enhancement by QW7437 microbubbles during
   contrast echocardiography. (C) 1999 by the American College of

	Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to measure the ultrasound (US)-mediated
   cavitation threshold of microdroplets as a function of its content and
   US parameters (frequency, amplitude and burst length). Albumin-coated
   droplets were prepared with perfluoropropane, perfluorohexane or
   perfluoromethylcyclohexane contents. The filtered suspensions were
   diluted to 1:1000 (v) and compared with Optison{''}. The formulations
   were injected into an acoustically transparent vessel and sonicated
   with a single focused transducer. The frequencies employed were 0.74,
   1.1, 2.18 and 3.3 MHz and the burst length and acoustic pressure were
   varied. The inertial cavitation threshold for each experiment was
   monitored through passive acoustic detection. The formation of droplet
   emulsion of the perfluorocarbon increased the natural boiling point of
   the perfluorocarbon. However, perfluorocarbon droplets having contents
   with higher molecular weights and boiling points did not have
   detectably higher inertial cavitation thresholds and, thus, the
   droplets do not need to be in a superheated state to be cavitated by US
   bursts. Therefore, higher boiling point perfluorocarbons should be
   investigated for this purpose and may prove to be useful for both
   imaging and therapy. The inertial cavitation threshold of
   perfluorocarbon droplets increases with frequency, and was
   approximately 0.7 MPa at 0.74 MHz and 1.75 MPa at 3.3 MHz. Optison{''},
   already in a gaseous state, has the lowest cavitation threshold of all
   formulations studied. Results show that, for the frequencies tested,
   there is no dependence between inertial cavitation threshold and burst
   lengths between 20 and 100 ms. As a conclusion, the inertial cavitation
   threshold of albumin-coated microdroplets of several perfluorocarbons
   was determined in vitro. The results indicate that the physical
   properties of these droplets are such that they may be useful for
   localized US therapies. (C) 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in

   slippage of fluid, using two complementary approaches. First, MD
   simulations of a corrugated hydrophobic surface have been performed. A
   dewetting transition, leading to a super-hydrophobic state, is observed
   for pressure below a ``capillary{''} pressure. Conversely, a very large
   slippage of the fluid on this composite interface is found in this
   super-hydrophobic state. Second, we propose a macroscopic estimate of
   the effective slip length on the basis of continuum hydrodynamics, in
   order to rationalize the previous TAD results. This calculation allows
   to estimate the effect of a heterogeneous slip length pattern at the
   composite interface. Comparison between the two approaches shows that
   they are in good agreement at low pressure, but highlights the role of
   the exact shape of the liquid-vapor interface at higher pressure. These
   results confirm that small variations in the roughness of a surface can
   lead to huge differences in the slip effect. On the basis of these
   results, we propose some guidelines to design highly slippery surfaces,

	Abstract = {For the first time, large amount of Janus silica particles as small as 100 nm in diameter were prepared through a simple method based on the elaboration of Pickering emulsions of wax-in-water. Controlling the kinetic stabilization of wax droplets allows the fabrication of gram-sized quantities of regular asymmetric inorganic particles with high yield. In fact, our method is based on a limited coalescence process, which allows one to predict the quantity of interface which is produced when working with a known mass of wax. and thus to be sure that all introduced silica particles are adsorbed on the wax surface. To this end, the hydrophilic Surface of the silica particles was made partially hydrophobic by adsorbing a known amount of surfactant: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CFAB). Varying the concentration in surfactant results in tuning the penetration rate of the particles in the wax droplets, leading to various dimension of the modified area. The broken spherical symmetry of the particle surface was thereafter revealed by the selective adsorption of gold nanoparticles on the amino-modified surface. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Water drops deposited on hydrophobic materials decorated with dilute micro-posts generally form pearls. Owing to the hydrophobicity of the material, the drop sits on the top of the posts. However, this "fakir state" is often metastable: if the drop impales inside the texture, its surface energy is lowered. Here we discuss the transition between these two states, considering the drop size as a parameter for inducing this transition: remarkably, it is found that a drop impales when it becomes small, which is interpreted by considering its curvature. This interpretation allows us to propose different recipes for avoiding this detrimental effect. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2008.},

	Abstract = {The temperature profile generated by differential evaporative cooling along the meniscus interface of volatile liquids in capillary tubes ranging from 600 to 1.630 mum is measured by the use of an IR camera. The great spatial resolution of the camera (similar to30 mum) and its sensitivity (20 mK at 30 degreesC) allowed us to capture the sink effect at the meniscus triple line where most of the evaporation takes place. The results clearly show that the sink effect increases with the reduction of the tube size and the use of more volatile liquids. We also demonstrated that the convection resulting from the self-induced evaporative cooling, affects the temperature profile along the meniscus interface. The practical difficulties in accessing to temperature measurements at the micro-scale are well recognized. The strong evaporation near the meniscus triple line is a key factor in many industrial applications such as heat pipes and crystal growth involving phase change. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

At the liquid-vapor interfaces, single or small groups of water molecules tend to leave the liquid surface.

The liquid -> vapor transition is initiated by local density fluctuations resulting in a nanometer-sized domain that exhibits both liquid and vapor characteristics. Though the rates of evaporation and condensation events increase dramatically in this area, the overall balance exhibits only a marginal net rate of evaporation. Growth of the precritical domain leads to the nucleation of a vapor phase in which isolated methane molecules are confined by a liquid-vapor interface. After crossing the transition state, the system experiences progressive destabilization of the liquid phase and the evaporation processes clearly outnumber the condensation events.},

	Abstract = {The liquid-vapor nucleation phenomenon is important for understanding the initial stage of a process such as cavitation, boiling and phreatic explosion. The recent development in molecular simulation has enabled us to study the bubble nucleation phenomena from a molecular point of view. The molecular dynamics simulations of the homogeneous liquid-vapor nucleation for a Lennard-Jones fluid were carried out to microscopically investigate the initial stage of bubble formation. The system pressure was reduced by an uniform system expansion to initiate the liquid-vapor nucleation in the metastable state. The nucleation rate was calculated at three different temperatures by the survival probability of the bubble-free state. As a result, the nucleation rate was seven to nine orders of magnitude greater than that estimated by the classical nucleation theory and the ratio of the nucleation rate by molecular simulation to the classical theory depended on the temperature. The volume of the bubble nucleus was also calculated by two different methods. (c) 2008 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Y-L equation is simply deduced from mechanical stability of a bubble, but it is still controversial whether the Y-L equation can be used for tiny bubbles, such as a "nano bubble", because the pressure difference divergently increases as the bubble radius R decreases. We investigated a spherical vapor bubble in Lennard-Jones liquid with molecular dynamics simulation, mainly looking into its mechanical stabilities. We generated a tiny bubble of various sizes (R similar or equal to 1.7-5 nm in argon unit) under equilibrium conditions by changing the simulation cell size and the number of molecules. The liquid pressure was evaluated with the virial expression, which was negative in general and was found to be strongly dependent on R. The vapor pressure was estimated from the vapor density via an empirical equation of state. The vapor pressure was found to be independent of R and very close to the vapor pressure at bulk liquid-vapor equilibrium. Then we assumed the Y-L equation to calculate the surface tension of the bubble, which turned out to be also independent of R. Thus we confirm that the Y-L equation is valid even for nano-scale bubbles. (c) 2008 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Rolisenow correlation {[}W.M. Rohsenow, A method of correlating heat

   good trend matching with the same experimental data. With the

   the rate of heat transfer with a diminishing trend of enhancement. A

	Abstract = {The phenomenon of apparent slip in micro-channel flows is analyzed by means 
of a two-phase mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann model including non-ideal fluid-fluid and fluid- 
wall interactions. The weakly inhomogeneous limit of this model is solved analytically. The 
present mesoscopic approach permits to access much larger scales than molecular dynamics, 
and comparable with those attained by continuum methods. However, at variance with the 
continuum approach, the existence of a gas layer near the wall does not need to be postulated a 
priori, but emerges naturally from the underlying non-ideal mesoscopic dynamics. It is therefore 
argued that a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann approach with non-ideal fluid-fluid and fluid-wall 
interactions might achieve an optimal compromise between physical realism and computational 
efficiency for the study of channel micro-flows.

	Abstract = {The physical behavior of a class of mesoscopic models for multiphase flows is analyzed in details near interfaces. In particular, an extended pseudopotential method is developed, which permits to tune the equation of state and surface tension independently of each other. The spurious velocity contributions of this extended model are shown to vanish in the limit of high grid refinement and/or high order isotropy. Higher order schemes to implement self-consistent forcings are rigorously computed for 2d and 3d models. The extended scenario developed in this work clarifies the theoretical foundations of the Shan-Chen methodology for the lattice Boltzmann method and enhances its applicability and flexibility to the simulation of multiphase flows to density ratios up to O(100).},

   GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It
   does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS,
   OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle
   polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is
   versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated
   functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily Customized.
   Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are
   incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC,
   GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations.

   dense, ring-like deposit along the perimeter (Fig. 1a). The
   coffee-initially dispersed over the entire drop-becomes concentrated
   into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever
   drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they

   deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine

   the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the
   contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from
   the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior, The resulting
   outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the

   been developed to measure instantaneous and ensemble-averaged flow
   fields in micron-scale fluidic devices. The system utilizes an

   intensified CCD camera to record high-resolution particle-image fields.
   Velocity vector fields can be measured with spatial resolutions down to
   6.9 x 6.9 x 1.5 mu m. The vector fields are analyzed using a
   double-frame cross-correlation algorithm. In this technique, the
   spatial resolution and the accuracy of the velocity measurements is
   limited by the diffraction limit of the recording optics, noise in the
   particle image field, and the interaction of the fluid with the
   finite-sized seed particles. The stochastic influence of Brownian
   motion plays a significant role in the accuracy of instantaneous

	Abstract = {Hydrodynamic cavitation in flows through a micro-orifice entrenched in a microchannel has been detected and experimentally investigated. Microfabrication techniques have been employed to design and develop a microfluidic device containing an 11.5 mum wide micro-orifice inside a 100.2 mum wide and 101.3 mum deep microchannel. The flow of de-ionized water through the micro-orifice reveals the presence of multifarious cavitating flow regimes. This investigation divulges both similarities and differences between cavitation in micro-orifices and cavitation in their macroscale counterparts. The low incipient cavitation number obtained from the current experiments suggests a dominant size scale effect. Choking cavitation is observed to be independent of any pressure or velocity scale effects. However, choking is significantly influenced by the small stream nuclei residence time at such scales. Flow rate choking leads to the establishment of a stationary cavity. Large flow and cavitation hysteresis have been detected at the microscale leading to very high desinent cavitation numbers. The rapid transition from incipient bubbles to choking cavitation and subsequent supercavitation suggests the presence of radically different flow patterns at the microscale. Supercavitation results in a thick cavity, which extends throughout the microchannel, and is encompassed by the liquid. Cavitation at the microscale is expected to considerably influence the design of innovative high-speed microfluidic systems. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

However, experimental results from various groups all across the world have shown various anomalies such as a peak in the enhancement of k with respect to nanoparticle size, an increase as well as a decrease in the ratio of k of these colloidal solutions with the k of the base fluid with increasing temperature, and a dependence of k on pH and time. In this paper, the aggregation kinetics of nanoscale colloidal solutions are combined with the physics of thermal transport to capture the effects of aggregation on k. Results show that the observed anomalies reported in experimental work can be well described by taking aggregation kinetics into account.

	Abstract = {Fast transient microboiling has been characterized on modified gold microheaters using a novel laser strobe microscopy technique. Microheater surfaces of different hydrophobicity were prepared using self-assembled monolayers of hexadecane thiol (hydrophobic) and 16-mercaptohexadecanol (hydrophilic) as well as the naturally hydrophilic bare gold surface. The microheater was immersed in a pool of water, and a 5-mu s voltage pulse to the heater was applied, causing superheating of the water and nucleation of a vapor bubble on the heater surface. Light from a pulsed Nd:Yag laser was configured to illuminate and image the sample through a microscope assembly. The timing of the short duration (7.5 ns) laser flash was varied with respect to the voltage pulse applied to the heater to create a series of images illuminated by the flash of the laser. These images were correlated with the transient resistance change of the heater both during and after the voltage pulse. It was found that hydrophobic surfaces produced a bubble that nucleated at an earlier time, grew more slowly to a smaller maximum size, and collapsed more rapidly than bubbles formed on hydrophilic surfaces.},

	Abstract = {The growth and departure of single bubbles on two smooth surfaces with very different wettabilities are studied using high-speed video microscopy and numerical simulations. Isolated artificial cavities of approximately 10 Am diameter are microfabricated on both a bare and a Teflon-coated silicon substrate to serve as nucleation sites. The bubble departure diameter is observed to be almost 3 times larger and the growth period almost 60 times longer for the hydrophobic surface than for the hydrophilic surface. The waiting period is practically zero for the hydrophobic surface because a small residual bubble nucleus is left behind on the cavity from a previous ebullition cycle. The experimental results are consistent with our numerical simulation results. Bubble nucleation occurs on nominally smooth hydrophobic regions with root mean square roughness (R-q) less than I run even at superheat as small as 3 degrees C. Liquid subcooling significantly affects bubble growth on the hydrophobic surface due to increased bubble surface area. Fundamental understanding of bubble dynamics on heated hydrophobic surfaces will facilitate the development of chemically patterned surfaces with enhanced boiling heat transfer performance and novel phase-change based micro-actuators and energy harvesters.

	Abstract = {Over the last half of the twentieth century, a number of purely empirical and mechanism-based cot-relations have been developed for pool nucleate boiling. Empirical correlations differ from each other substantially with respect to the functional dependence of heat flux on fluid and surface properties, including gravity. The mechanism-based correlations require knowledge of the number density of active sites, bubble diameter at departure, and bubble-release frequency. However, because of the complex nature of the subprocesses involved, it has not been possible to develop comprehensive models or correlations for these parameters. This, in turn, has led to the pessimistic view that mechanistic prediction of nucleate boiling is a hopeless task. However there is an alternative to the past approaches-complete numerical simulation of the boiling process. Value of this approach for bubble dynamics and associated heat transfer is shown through excellent agreement of predictions with data obtained on microfabricated surfaces on which active nucleation sites can be controlled.},

	Abstract = {{The translational velocities of two spherical gas bubbles oscillating
   in water, which is irradiated by a high-intensity acoustic wave field,
   are calculated. The two bubbles are assumed to be located far enough
   apart so that shape oscillations can be neglected. Viscous effects are
   included owing to the small size of the bubbles. An asymptotic solution
   is obtained that accounts for the viscous drag on each bubble, for
   large Re based on the radial part of the motion, in a form similar to
   the leading-order prediction by Levich (1962), C-D = 48/ReT; Re-T -->
   infinity based on the translational velocity. In this context the
   translational velocity of each bubble, which is a direct measure of the
   secondary Bjerknes force between the two bubbles, is evaluated
   asymptotically and calculated numerically for sound intensities as
   large as the Blake threshold. Two cases are examined. First, two
   bubbles of unequal size with radii on the order of 100 pm are subjected
   to a sound wave with amplitude P-A < 1.0 bar and forcing frequency w(f)
   =0.51w(10), so that the second harmonic falls within the range defined
   by the eigenfrequencies of the two bubbles, w(10)<2w(f)<w(20). It is
   shown that their translational velocity changes sign, becoming
   repulsive as PA increases from 0.05 to 0.1 bar due to the growing
   second harmonic, 2w(f), of the forcing frequency. However, as the
   amplitude of sound further increases, P-A approximate to 0.5 bar, the
   two bubbles attract each other due to the growth of even higher
   harmonics that fall outside the range defined by the eigenfrequencies
   of the two bubbles. Second, the case of much smaller bubbles is
   examined, radii on the order of 10 mum, driven well below resonance,
   w(f)/2pi = 20 kHz, at very large sound intensities, P-A approximate to
   1 bar. Numerical simulations show that the forces between the two
   bubbles tend to be attractive, except for a narrow region of bubble
   size corresponding to a nonlinear resonance related to the Blake
   threshold. As the distance between them decreases, the region of
   repulsion is shifted, indicating sign inversion of their mutual force.
   Extensive numerical simulations indicate the formation of bubble pairs
   with constant average inter-bubble distance, consisting of bubbles with
   equilibrium radii determined by the primary and secondary resonance
   frequencies for small and moderate sound amplitudes or by the Blake
   threshold for large sound amplitudes. It is conjectured that in
   experiments where `acoustic streamers' are observed, which are
   filamentary structures consisting of bubbles that are aligned and move
   rapidly in a cavitating fluid at nearly constant distances from each
   other, bubbles with size determined by the Blake threshold are
   predominant because those with size determined by linear resonance are
   larger and therefore become unstable due to shape oscillations.}},

   The crossover frequency between weak and strong phonon scattering is
   controlled by the coordination and shifts to zero as the system is
   decompressed toward the critical packing fraction at which rigidity is
   lost. We present a scaling analysis that relates the packing fraction
   dependence of the crossover frequency to the anomalous scaling of the
   shear modulus with compression. Below the crossover, the diffusivity
   displays a power-law divergence with inverse frequency consistent with
   Rayleigh law, which suggests that the vibrational modes are primarily
   transverse waves, weakly scattered by disorder. Above it, a large
   number of modes appear whose diffusivity plateaus at a nearly constant
   value before dropping to zero above the localization frequency. The

	Abstract = {{Underwater bubbles can inhibit sound transmission through water due to
   density mismatch and concomitant reflection and absorption of sound
   waves. For the present study, a perforated rubber hose was used to
   produce a bubble curtain, or screen, around pile-driving activity in
   6-8-m depth waters of western Hong Kong. The percussive hammer blow
   sounds of the pile driver we:re measured on 2 days at distances of 250,
   500, and 1000 m; broadband pulse levels were reduced by 3-5 dB by the
   bubble curtain. Sound intensities were measured from 100 Hz to 25.6
   kHz, and greatest sound reduction by the bubble curtain was evident
   from 400 to 6400 Hz. Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (Sousa
   chinensis) occurred in the immediate area of the industrial activity
   before and during pile driving, but with a lower abundance immediately
   after it. While hump-backed dolphins generally showed no overt
   behavioral changes with and without pile driving, their speeds of
   travel increased during pile driving, indicating that bubble screening
   did not eliminate all behavioral responses to the loud noise. Because
   the bubble curtain effectively lowered sound levels within 1 km of the
   activity, the experiment and its application during construction
   represented a success, and this measure should be considered for other
   appropriate areas with high industrial noises and resident or migrating
   sound-sensitive animals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   predators deploying bubbles during foraging activities. However, the
   effects of bubbles on schooling prey organisms remain poorly
   understood. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to gain
   insight into the effect of bubbles on the Pacific herring, Clupea
   harengus pallasi, a principal prey species of the humpback whale,
   Megaptera novaeangliae. The fish exhibited strong avoidance of bubbles
   and could be contained within a circular bubble net. The herring
   schools were also reluctant to swim through a curtain of bubbles even
   when frightened. However, herring were much more willing to cross a
   bubble curtain or net if there was a larger aggregation of fish on the
   opposite side. Individuals and small groups of herring also waited for
   less time before crossing than did larger groups. These experiments
   suggest that herring have a strong fear of bubbles and can readily be
   manipulated or contained within bubble nets by predators.}},

@article{lei04,
	Abstract = {{Gas bubbles are the most potent naturally-occurring entities that
   influence the acoustic environment in liquids. Upon entrainment under
   breaking waves, waterfalls, or rainfall over water, each bubble
   undergoes small amplitude decaying pulsations with a natural frequency
   that varies approximately inversely with the bubble radius, giving rise
   to the ``plink{''} of a dripping tap or the roar of a cataract. When
   they occur in their millions per cubic metre in the top few metres of
   the ocean, bubbles can dominate the underwater sound field. Similarly,
   when driven by an incident sound field, bubbles exhibit a strong
   pulsation resonance. Acoustic scatter by bubbles can confound sonar in
   the shallow waters which typify many modern maritime military
   operations. If they are driven by sound fields of sufficient amplitude,
   the bubble pulsations can become highly nonlinear. These nonlinearities
   might be exploited to enhance sonar, or to monitor the bubble
   population: Such oceanic monitoring is important, for example, because
   of the significant contribution made by bubbles to the greenhouse gas
   budget. In industry, bubble monitoring is required for sparging,
   electrochemical processes, the production of paints, pharamaceuticals
   and foodstuffs. At yet higher amplitudes of pulsation, gas compression
   within the collapsing bubble can generate temperatures of several
   thousand Kelvin whilst, in the liquid, shock waves and shear can
   produce erosion and bioeffects. Not only can these effects be exploited
   in industrial cleaning and manufacturing, and research into novel
   chemical processes, but we need to understand (and if possible control)
   their occurrence when biomedical ultrasound is passed through the body.
   This is because the potential of such bubble-related physical and
   chemical processes to damage tissue will be desireable in some
   circumstances (e.g. ultrasonic kidney stone therapy), and undesireable
   in-others (e.g. foetal scanning). This paper describes this range of
   behaviour. Further information on these topics, including sound and
   video files, can be found at http://www.isvr.soton.ac.uk/fdag/ijmpb.htm.}},

   vertically pointing pencil beam sonars mounted on the U.S. submarine
   Dolphin was carried out to measure turbulence in near-surface regions

   A forward-pointing side-scan sonar determined the `'age'' of bubble

   turbulent dissipation in the bubble clouds, and the dissipation rate
   close to the surface exceeds that predicted using conventional
   calculations based on the law of the wall and buoyancy flux. The
   correspondence between bubbles and turbulence implies a horizontally
   patchy turbulent structure near the surface. Below the base of the

   much greater than that of the bubble clouds. The submarine provides an

	Abstract = {{Recent updates in the held of echocardiography have resulted in
   improvements in image quality, especially in those patients whose
   ultrasonographic (ultrasound) evaluation was previously suboptimal
   Intravenous contrast agents are now available in the United States and
   Europe for the indication of left ventricular opacification and
   enhanced endocardial border delineation. The use of contrast enables
   acquisition of ultrasound images of improved quality. The technique is
   especially useful in obese patients and those with lung disease.
   Patients in these categories comprise approximately 10\% to 20\% of
   routine echocardiographic examinations. Stress echocardiography
   examinations can be even more challenging, as the image acquisition
   time factor is critically important for accurate detection of coronary
   disease. Improvements in image quality with intravenous contrast agents
   can facilitate image acquisition and enhance delineation of regional
   wall motion abnormalities at the peak level of exercise. Recent phase
   III clinical trial data on the use of Optison and several other agents
   (currently under evaluation) have revealed that for approximately half
   of patients, image quality substantively improves, which enables the
   examination to be salvaged and/or increases diagnostic accuracy. For
   the ``difficult-to-image{''} patient, this added information results in
   (1) enhanced Laboratory efficiency, (2) a reduction in downstream
   testing, and (3) possible improvements in patient outcome. In addition,
   substantial research efforts are underway to use ultrasound contrast
   agents for assessment of myocardial perfusion. The detection of
   myocardial perfusion during echocardiographic examinations will permit
   the simultaneous assessment of global and regional myocardial
   structure, function, and perfusion-all of the indicators necessary to
   enable the optimal noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease.
   Despite the added benefit in improved efficacy of testing, few data
   exist regarding the long-term effectiveness of these agents. Currently
   under evaluation are the clinical and economic outcome implications of
   intravenous contrast agent use for daily clinical decision making in a
   variety of patient subsets. Until these data are known, this document
   offers a preliminary synthesis of available evidence on the value of
   intravenous contrast agents for use in rest and stress
   echocardiography. At present, it is the position of this guideline
   committee that intravenous contrast agents demonstrate substantial
   value in the difficult-to-image patient with comorbid conditions
   limiting an ultrasound evaluation of the heart. For such patients, the
   use of intravenous contrast agents should be encouraged as a means to
   provide added diagnostic information and to streamline early detection
   and treatment of underlying cardiac pathophysiology. As with all new
   technology, this document will require updates and revisions as
   additional data become available.}},

	Abstract = {{The problem of the propagation of acoustic waves in a one-dimensional
   bubbly liquid, either periodic or random is considered. This example of
   wave-scatterers interaction is complex enough to illustrate many of its
   general characteristics and yet simple enough so that an exact solution
   of the theoretical model can be found. Indeed, it is possible to
   compute exactly the response of the bubbly liquid to an incident wave
   in any range of concentrations, bubble size polydispersity and
   frequency range. In the near-field or high concentration regime, these
   solutions are particularly interesting since the 3-D problem cannot be
   solved in general. This analysis exhibits three main regimes, depending
   on the average value of the bubble radius R, average distance d between
   bubbles, and wavelength-lambda in the liquid. (1) For R
   less-than-or-equal-to lambda and d less-than-or-equal-to lambda, this
   is the ``phonon{''} or ``mass-spring{''} regime: the compressible
   bubbles act as springs connecting rigid incompressible fluid slabs that
   play the role of the masses in between the ``springs{''}. (2) For R
   less-than-or-equal-to lambda less-than-or-equal-to d, bubbles present a
   kind of resonance, which is the 1 -D analog of the standard 3-D bubble
   internal resonance. Furthermore, bubbles are coupled to each other by
   their radiations that propagate away in the compressible fluid: This is
   the ``bubble{''} regime, which is the 1-D counterpart of the standard
   3-D problem of an acoustic wave propagating in a diluted solution of
   small bubbles. (3) For lambda less-than-or-equal-to R and lambda
   less-than-or-equal-to d, the compressibility of the bubbles does not
   lead anymore to a resonance. This is the ``stratified{''} regime, where
   the liquid and gas layers play symmetric roles. In the periodic
   systems, the dispersion relations and band structures are found. In the
   random systems, we compute the Anderson localization length, both
   numerically and analytically in the limit of uncorrelated disorder, for
   various system realizations.}},

   effects, the collapse of the cloud is accompanied by the formation of
   an inward propagating bubbly shock wave. A large pressure pulse is
   produced when this shock passes the bubbles and causes them to

	Abstract = {The dynamics of friction have been studied for hundreds of years, yet
   many aspects of these everyday processes are not understood. One such
   aspect is the onset of frictional motion ( slip). First described more
   than 200 years ago as the transition from static to dynamic friction,
   the onset of slip is central to fields as diverse as physics(1-3),
   tribology(4,5), mechanics of earthquakes(6-11) and fracture(12-14). Here
   we show that the onset of frictional slip is governed by three different
   types of coherent crack-like fronts: these are observed by real-time
   visualization of the net contact area that forms the interface
   separating two blocks of like material. Two of these fronts, which
   propagate at subsonic and intersonic velocities, have been the subject
   of intensive recent interest(12-17). We show that a third type of front,
   which propagates an order of magnitude more slowly, is the dominant
   mechanism for the rupture of the interface. No overall motion ( sliding)
   of the blocks occurs until either of the slower two fronts traverses the
   entire interface.},

	Abstract = {{The dynamics of water drop impact at high impinging velocity onto
   superhydrophobic substrates is experimentally investigated. The solid
   substrate-comprised of regular and hydrophobic micropillars-is
   transparent, thereby facilitating close-up, top-or-bottom-view,
   high-speed imaging. With a sufficient impact velocity, instead of a
   completely-bouncing ``Fakir{''} droplet, wetting splashing can occur,
   with an entrapped air bubble at the centre surrounded by a wetted area
   as well as an emission of satellite droplets during the advancing phase
   of spreading lamella. A large portion of the lamella travels upon air
   and subsequently recoils due to surface tension, forming a partial
   rebound on the central wet spot. We present and discuss quantitative
   results of the entrapped air bubble, the central wetted area, and the
   maximal spreading lamella as the impact velocity is increased. We
   further vary the lattice periodicity of the micro-patterns and find its
   profound influence on the macroscopic flow. More specifically,
   directional splashing can emerge, emitting secondary droplets in certain
   directions which are associated with the lattice. Directional splashing
   can be suppressed to a gentle spreading by decreasing the periodicity of
   the lattice and, furthermore, can be tuned to a completely-wetting
   splashing in the diagonal directions of the lattice by a larger
   periodicity, offering opportunities to control the wetting process.
   Finally, the elimination of directional splashing by reducing air
   pressure suggests that the underlying air is squeezed outwards by the
   falling droplet upon the solid boundary whereby the air flow is
   affected, leading to different splashing behavior.}},

	Abstract = {{The collision dynamics of a liquid droplet on a solid metallic surface
   were studied using a flash photographic method.  The intent was to
   provide clear images of the droplet structure during the deformation
   process.  The ambient pressure (0.101 MPa), surface material (polished
   stainless steel), initial droplet diameter (about 1.5 mm), liquid
   (n-heptane) and impact Weber number (43) were fixed.  The primary
   parameter was the surface temperature, which ranged from 24-degrees-C to
   above the Leidenfrost temperature of the liquid.  Experiments were also
   performed on a droplet impacting a surface on which there existed a
   liquid film created by deposition of a prior droplet.
   The evolution of wetted area and spreading rate, both of a droplet on a
   stainless steel surface and of a droplet spreading over a thin liquid
   film, were found to be independent of surface temperature during the
   early period of impact.  This result was attributed to negligible
   surface tension and viscous effects, and in consequence the measurements
   made during the early period of the impact process were in good
   agreement with previously published analyses which neglected these
   effects.  A single bubble was observed to form within the droplet during
   impact at low temperatures.  As surface temperature was increased the
   population of bubbles within the droplet also increased because of
   progressive activation of nucleation sites on the stainless steel
   surface.  At surface temperatures near to the boiling point of heptane,
   a spokelike cellular structure in the liquid was created during the
   spreading process by coalescence of a ring of bubbles that had formed
   within the droplet.  At higher temperatures, but below the Leidenfrost
   point, numerous bubbles appeared within the droplet, yet the overall
   droplet shape, particularly in the early stages of impact (< 0.8 ms),
   was unaffected by the presence of these bubbles.  The maximum value of
   the diameter of liquid which spreads on the surface is shown to agree
   with predictions from a simplified model.}},

	Abstract = { Abstract The review deals with drop impacts on thin liquid layers and dry surfaces. The impacts resulting in crown formation are referred to as splashing. Crowns and their propagation are discussed in detail, as well as some additional kindred, albeit nonsplashing, phenomena like drop spreading and deposition, receding (recoil), jetting, fingering, and rebound. The review begins with an explanation of various practical motivations feeding the interest in the fascinating phenomena of drop impact, and the above-mentioned topics are then considered in their experimental, theoretical, and computational aspects. },

	Abstract = { We discuss in this review how the roughness of a solid impacts its wettability. We see in particular that both the apparent contact angle and the contact angle hysteresis can be dramatically affected by the presence of roughness. Owing to the development of refined methods for setting very well-controlled micro- or nanotextures on a solid, these effects are being exploited to induce novel wetting properties, such as spontaneous filmification, superhydrophobicity, superoleophobicity, and interfacial slip, that could not be achieved without roughness. },

   brief description of the shape of a Leidenfrost drop, we show that its
   size cannot exceed a certain value. Then, we describe the
   characteristics of the vapor layer on which it floats. We show how it is
   related to the drop size, and how both vary with time, as evaporation
   takes place. We finally deduce scaling laws for the lifetime of these

	Abstract = {{At the impact of a liquid droplet on a smooth surface heated above the
   liquid's boiling point, the droplet either immediately boils when it
   contacts the surface ({''}contact boiling''), or without any surface
   contact forms a Leidenfrost vapor layer towards the hot surface and
   bounces back ({''}gentle film boiling''), or both forms the Leidenfrost
   layer and ejects tiny droplets upward ({''}spraying film boiling''). We
   experimentally determine conditions under which impact behaviors in each
   regime can be realized. We show that the dimensionless maximum spreading
   gamma of impacting droplets on the heated surfaces in both gentle and
   spraying film boiling regimes shows a universal scaling with the Weber
   numberWe (gamma similar to We(2/5)), which is much steeper than for the
   impact on nonheated (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) surfaces (gamma similar
   to We(1/4)). We also interferometrically measure the vapor thickness
   under the droplet.}},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT To investigate the phenomena of skin-friction drag reduction in a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) at large scales and high Reynolds numbers, a set of experiments has been conducted at the US Navy's William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel (LCC). Drag reduction was achieved by injecting gas (air) from a line source through the wall of a nearly zero-pressure-gradient TBL that formed on a flat-plate test model that was either hydraulically smooth or fully rough. Two distinct drag-reduction phenomena were investigated; bubble drag reduction (BDR) and air-layer drag reduction (ALDR).The streamwise distribution of skin-friction drag reduction was monitored with six skin-friction balances at downstream-distance-based Reynolds numbers to 220 million and at test speeds to 20.0msinitial zone1. These results indicated that there are three distinct regions associated with drag reduction with air injection: Region I, BDR; Region II, transition between BDR and ALDR; and Region III, ALDR. In addition, once ALDR was established: friction drag reduction in excess of 80\% was observed over the entire smooth model for speeds to 15.3ms1 with the surface fully roughened (though approximately 50\% greater volumetric air flux was required); and ALDR was sensitive to the inflow conditions. The sensitivity to the inflow conditions can be mitigated by employing a small faired step (10mm height in the experiment) that helps to create a fixed separation line.},

	Abstract = {Air-induced drag reduction was investigated on a 12.9 m long flat plate test model at a free stream speed of 6.3 m s−1. Measurements of the local skin friction, phase velocity profiles (liquid and gas) and void fraction profiles were acquired at downstream distances to 11.5 m, which yielded downstream-distance-based Reynolds numbers above 80 million. Air was injected within the boundary layer behind a 13 mm backward facing step (BFS) while the incoming boundary layer was perturbed with vortex generators in various configurations immediately upstream of the BFS. Measurements confirmed that air layer drag reduction (ALDR) is sensitive to upstream disturbances, but a clean boundary layer separation line (i.e. the BFS) reduces such sensitivity. Empirical scaling of the experimental data was investigated for: (a) the critical air flux required to establish ALDR; (b) void fraction profiles; and (c) the interfacial velocity profiles. A scaling of the critical air flux for ALDR was developed from balancing shear-induced lift forces and buoyancy forces on a single bubble within a shear flow. The resulting scaling successfully collapses ALDR results from the current and past studies over a range of flow conditions and test model configurations. The interfacial velocity and void fraction profiles were acquired and scaled within the bubble drag reduction (BDR), ALDR and transitional ALDR regimes. The BDR interfacial velocity profile revealed that there was slip between phases. The ALDR results showed that the air layer thickness was nominally three-quarters of the total volumetric flux (per unit span) of air injected divided by the free stream speed. Furthermore, the air layer had an average void fraction of 0.75 and a velocity of approximately 0.2 times the free stream speed. Beyond the air layer was a bubbly mixture that scaled in a similar fashion to the BDR results. Transitional ALDR results indicate that this regime was comprised of intermittent generation and subsequent fragmentation of an air layer, with the resulting drag reduction determined by the fraction of time that an air layer was present.},

@article{takagi2008,
	Abstract = {It is well known that a bubble in contaminated water rises much slower than one in purified water, and the rising velocity in a contaminated system can be less than half that in a purified system. This phenomenon is explained by the so-called Marangoni effect caused by surfactant adsorption on the bubble surface. In other words, while a bubble is rising, there exists a surface concentration distribution of surfactant along the bubble surface because the adsorbed surfactant is swept off from the front part and accumulates in the rear part by advection. Owing to this surfactant accumulation in the rear part, a variation of surface tension appears along the surface and this causes a tangential shear stress on the bubble surface. This shear stress results in the decrease in the rising velocity of the bubble in contaminated liquid. More interestingly, this Marangoni effect influences not only the bubble's rising velocity but also its lateral migration in the presence of mean shear. Together, these influences cause a drastic change of the whole bubbly flow structures. In this paper, we discuss some experimental results related to this drastic change in bubbly flow structure. We show that bubble clustering phenomena are observed in an upward bubbly channel flow under certain conditions of surfactant concentrations. This cluster disappears with an increase in the concentration. We explain this phenomenon by reference to the lift force acting on a bubble in aqueous surfactant solutions. It is shown that the shear-induced lift force acting on a contaminated bubble of 1mm size can be much smaller than that on a clean bubble.},
