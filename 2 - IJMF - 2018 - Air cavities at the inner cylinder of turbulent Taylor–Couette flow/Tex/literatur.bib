	Abstract = {{Both the inherent intractability and complex beauty of turbulence reside
   in its large range of physical and temporal scales. This range of scales
   is captured by the Reynolds number, which in nature and in many
   engineering applications can be as large as 10(5)-10(6). Here, we report
   turbulence measurements over an unprecedented range of Reynolds numbers
   using a unique combination of a high-pressure air facility and a new
   nanoscale anemometry probe. The results reveal previously unknown
   universal scaling behavior for the turbulent velocity fluctuations,
   which is remarkably similar to the well-known scaling behavior of the
   mean velocity distribution.}},

The high-quality DNS data in the inertial subrange and the dissipative range enable the examination of detailed statistics at small scales, such as the normalized energy-dissipation rate, energy and energy-flux spectra, the intermittency of the velocity gradients and increments, scaling exponents, and flow-field structure.

@article{chi08b,
	Abstract = {An interesting question in turbulent convection is how the heat transport depends on the strength of thermal forcing in the limit of very large thermal forcing. Kraichnan predicted [Phys. Fluids 5, 1374 (1962) ] that for fluids with low Prandtl number (Pr), the heat transport measured by the Nusselt number (Nu) would depend on the strength of thermal forcing measured by the Rayleigh number (Ra) as Nu similar to Ra-1/2 with logarithmic corrections at very high Ra. According to Kraichnan, the shear boundary layers play a crucial role in giving rise to this so-called ultimate-state scaling. A similar scaling result is predicted by the Grossmann-Lohse theory [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000)], but with the assumption that the ultimate state is a bulk- dominated state in which both the average kinetic and thermal dissipation rates are dominated by contributions from the bulk of the flow with the boundary layers either broken down or playing no role in the heat transport. In this paper, we study the dependence of Nu and the Reynolds number (Re) measuring the root-mean-squared velocity fluctuations on Ra and Pr, for low Pr, using a shell model for homogeneous turbulent convection where buoyancy is acting directly on most of the scales. We find that Nu similar to (RaPr1/2)-Pr-1/2 and Re similar to (RaPr-1/2)-Pr-1/2, which resemble the ultimatestate scaling behavior for fluids with low Pr, and show that the presence of a drag acting on the large scales is crucial in giving rise to such scaling. As a large-scale drag cannot exist by itself in the bulk of turbulent thermal convection, our results indicate that if buoyancy acts on most of the scales in the bulk of turbulent convection at very high Ra, then the ultimate state cannot be bulk dominated.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in turbulence research is to understand from first principles the origin of the anomalous scaling of velocity fluctuations in high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. One important idea was proposed by Kolmogorov [J. Fluid Mech. 13, 82 (1962)], which attributes the anomaly to variations of the locally averaged energy dissipation rate. Kraichnan later pointed out [J. Fluid Mech. 62, 305 (1973)] that the locally averaged energy dissipation rate is not an inertial-range quantity and a proper inertial-range quantity would be the local energy transfer rate. As a result, Kraichnan's idea attributes the anomaly to variations of the local energy transfer rate. These ideas, generally known as refined similarity hypotheses, can also be extended to study the anomalous scaling of fluctuations of an active scalar, such as the temperature in turbulent convection. We examine the validity of these refined similarity hypotheses and their extensions to an active scalar in shell models of homogeneous turbulence and turbulent convection. We find that Kraichnan's refined similarity hypothesis and its extension are valid.},

	Abstract = {Different scaling behavior has been reported in various shell models proposed for turbulent thermal convection. In this paper, we show that buoyancy is not always relevant to the statistical properties of these shell models even though there is an explicit coupling between velocity and temperature in the equations of motion. When buoyancy is relevant (irrelevant) to the statistical properties, the scaling behavior is Bolgiano-Obukhov (Kolmogorov) plus intermittency corrections. We show that the intermittency corrections of temperature could be solely attributed to fluctuations in the entropy transfer rate when buoyancy is relevant but due to fluctuations in both energy and entropy transfer rates when buoyancy is irrelevant. This difference can be used as a criterion to distinguish whether temperature is behaving as an active or a passive scalar. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This optical arrangement gives the possibility to measure the critical dependence of both the intensity linewidth and the correlation function of the phase time derivative, in SF6 near its gas-liquid critical point. We showed both experimentally and theoretically that the critical behaviour of the phase time derivative correlation function is determined by the thermodiffusive mode critical dependence, similar to the intensity linewidth. A good agreement between the experimental results and the theory is found.},

We show that in three-dimensional space the Gortler vortices are randomly distributed in banded regions on the wall, concentrating at the outflow boundaries of Taylor vortex cells, which spread over the entire cylinder surface with increasing Reynolds number. Gortler vortices cause streaky structures that form herringbone-like patterns near the wall. For the Reynolds numbers studied here, the average axial spacing of the streaks is approximately 100 viscous wall units, and the average tilting angle ranges from 16 degrees to 20 degrees. Simulation results have been compared to the experimental data in the literature, and the flow dynamics and statistics are discussed in detail.},

The inner-and outer-cylinder Reynolds numbers have the same magnitude, which ranges from 500 to 4000 in the simulations. We show that with the increase of Reynolds number, the prevailing structures in the flow are azimuthal vortices with scales much smaller than the cylinder gap. At high Reynolds numbers, while the instantaneous small-scale vortices permeate the entire domain, the large-scale Taylor vortex motions manifested by the time-averaged field do not penetrate a layer of fluid near the outer cylinder. Comparisons between the standard Taylor-Couette system (rotating inner cylinder, fixed outer cylinder) and the counter-rotating system demonstrate the profound effects of the Coriolis force on the mean flow and other statistical quantities. The dynamical and statistical features of the flow have been investigated in detail.},

	Abstract = {{We present numerical simulations of the flow in a rapidly rotating
   cylindrical annulus. We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the
   magneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the
   Taylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely
   by the end-plates. We then consider two possible options for minimizing
   these end-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and
   (ii) splitting the end-plates into a series of differentially rotating
   rings. Regarding option (i), we show that the cylinder would have to be
   hundreds of times as long as it is wide before end-effects become
   unimportant in the interior. Since this is clearly not feasible. we turn
   to option (ii). and show that in order to obtain a smooth angular
   velocity profile, the end-plates would have to be split into around ten
   rings. If the end-plates are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3-5, the
   angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of
   a series of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the
   next. We suggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this
   system will be the familiar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these
   Stewartson layers, rather than the magneto-rotational instability. At
   best, one might hope to obtain the MRI superimposed on these
   Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of results is thus
   likely to be quite complicated.}},

	Abstract = {A unique pattern selection in the absolutely unstable regime of a driven, nonlinear, open-flow system is analyzed: The spatiotemporal structures of rotationally symmetric vortices that propagate downstream in the annulus of the rotating Taylor-Couette system due to an externally imposed axial through-flow are investigated for two different axial boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet. Detailed quantitative results for the oscillation frequency, the axial profile of the wave number, and the temporal Fourier amplitudes of the propagating vortex patterns obtained by numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations are compared with results of the appropriate Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation approximation and also with experiments. Unlike the stationary patterns in systems without through-flow the spatiotemporal structures of propagating vortices are independent of parameter history, initial conditions, and system length. They do, however, depend on the axial boundary conditions in addition to the driving rate of the inner cylinder and the through-flow rate, Our analysis of the amplitude equation shows that the pattern selection can be described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with the frequency being the eigenvalue. The complex amplitude being the corresponding eigenfunction describes the axial structure of intensity and wave number. Small, but characteristic differences in the structural dynamics between the Navier-Stokes equations and the amplitude equation are mainly due to the different dispersion relations. Approaching the border between absolute and convective instability the eigenvalue problem becomes effectively linear and the selection mechanism approaches that of linear front propagation.},

   Accuracy is limited instead by roundoff sensitivity due to
   non-normality of the stability operators at large hydrodynamic and/or
   magnetic Reynolds numbers (Re. Rm greater than or similar to 4 x
   10(4)). In problems with Hartmann velocity and magnetic-field profiles
   we employ suitable Gauss quadrature rules to evaluate the associated
   exponentially weighted sesquilinear forms without error. An alternative
   approach. which involves approximating the forms by means of
   Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature at the 2p - 1 precision level, is
   found to yield equal eigenvalues within roundoff error. As a
   consistency check, we compare modal growth rates to energy growth rates

	Abstract = {{The vigor of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is
   thought to be vulnerable to global warming, but its short-term temporal
   variability is unknown so changes inferred from sparse observations on
   the decadal time scale of recent climate change are uncertain. We
   combine continuous measurements of the MOC (beginning in 2004) using the
   purposefully designed transatlantic Rapid Climate Change array of moored
   instruments deployed along 26.5 degrees N, with time series of Gulf
   Stream transport and surface-layer Ekman transport to quantify its
   intra-annual variability. The year-long average overturning is 18.7 +/-
   5.6 sverdrups (Sv) (range: 4.0 to 34.9 Sv, where 1 Sv = a flow of ocean
   water of 10(6) cubic meters per second). Interannual changes in the
   overturning can be monitored with a resolution of 1.5 Sv.}},
